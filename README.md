# 🛠️ Kitchen Renovation AI Agent with Gemini, ADK & Vertex AI

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy an autonomous AI agent using Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Vertex AI. The goal? Automatically generate a detailed renovation proposal for a kitchen remodel using the power of multi-agent collaboration, structured prompt engineering, and AI-driven decision-making. This was created part of Code Vipaasana program organised by Ms. Abhirami- Lead Developer Advocate, Google and team

> 🚀 Designed to show how AI agents can solve real-world tasks, even ones you never thought you'd automate—like remodeling your kitchen!

## 🧠 What's Inside

- 🤖 **AI Agent (ADK)** – A goal-based autonomous agent using the Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- 🧾 **Proposal Generator** – Generates a highly detailed renovation proposal document
- ☁️ **Google Cloud Storage** – Stores the output documents securely
- 🧱 **Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Google AI Studio)** – Handles the core generation and reasoning tasks
- 🗂️ **AllowDB** – Lightweight, embedded data store to maintain agent context and memory
- 🛠️ **Cloud Shell Integration** – For local and cloud-based testing
- 🌐 **Agent Web Output** – See your agent's results in real time
